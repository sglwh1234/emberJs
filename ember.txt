Some of these features that you'll learn about in the guides are:
Ember CLI - A robust development toolkit to create, develop, and build Ember applications. When you see an $ ember <command> instruction throughout the guides, that's Ember CLI!
Routing - The central part of an Ember application. Enables developers to drive the application state from the URL.

Templating engine - Use Handlebars syntax to write your application's templates

Data layer - Ember Data provides a consistent way to communicate with external APIs and manage application state

Ember Inspector - A browser extension, or bookmarklet, to inspect your application live. It's also useful for spotting Ember applications in the wild, try to install it and open up the NASA website


To make the most out of the guides, you should have a working knowledge of:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript - the building blocks of web pages. You can find documentation of each of these technologies at the Mozilla Developer Network.
Promises - the native way to deal with asynchrony in your JavaScript code. See the relevant Mozilla Developer Network section.
ES2015 modules - you will better understand Ember CLI's project structure and import paths if you are comfortable with JavaScript Modules.
ES2015 syntax - Ember CLI comes with Babel.js by default so you can take advantage of newer language features such as arrow functions, template strings, destructuring, and more. You can check the Babel.js documentation or read Understanding ECMAScript 6 online.
